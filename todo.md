## **Project: Winget2Intunewin GUI Packer**

**I. GUI Foundation & Setup (Milestone 1)**
- [x] Design the main application window layout.
- [x] Implement the main window using the chosen GUI framework (PySide6).
- [x] Apply a sleek modern dark mode theme.
- [x] Create essential UI elements:
    - [x] Input field for application search.
    - [x] "Search" button.
    - [x] Display area for search results (table or list).
    - [x] Button/mechanism to select an application from results.
    - [x] Input field/dialog for specifying the output folder for `.intunewin` file.
    - [x] "Package" button.
    - [x] Status display area (log window or status bar).
- [x] Set up basic project structure (folders for UI files, logic, assets, etc.).
- [x] Initialize `requirements.txt` with Python, GUI framework.

**II. Winget Application Search (Milestone 2 & Key Feature 1)**
- [x] Implement backend logic to execute `winget search <keyword>` command using `subprocess`.
- [x] Parse the output from the `winget search` command.
- [x] Populate the GUI's display area with search results (Application Name, ID, Version, Source).
- [x] Implement functionality for users to select an application from the search results (Key Feature 2).

**III. Automated Installer Download (Milestone 3 & Key Feature 3)**
- [x] Implement logic to create a temporary, structured directory for downloads and scripts.
- [x] Implement backend logic to execute `winget download --id <app-id> --download-directory <temp-dir>` (or similar, based on exact winget capabilities).
- [x] Ensure the downloaded installer is saved to the designated temporary directory.

**IV. Automated PowerShell Script Generation (Milestone 4 & Key Feature 4)**
- [x] Develop Python functions to generate `install.ps1`:
    - [x] Script should use `winget install --id <app-id> --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements <any-other-silent-flags>`.
- [x] Develop Python functions to generate `uninstall.ps1`:
    - [x] Script should use `winget uninstall --id <app-id> --accept-package-agreements <any-other-silent-flags>`.
- [x] Develop Python functions to generate `detection.ps1`:
    - [x] Script should use `winget list --id <app-id>` and parse output to confirm installation.
- [x] Ensure generated scripts are saved to the temporary directory alongside the installer.

**V. .intunewin File Creation (Milestone 5 & Key Feature 5)**
- [x] Integrate `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`:
    - [x] Add a configuration option (e.g., in settings or at first run) for the user to specify the path to `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`.
    - [x] Store this path persistently.
- [x] Implement logic to execute `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` programmatically using `subprocess`.
    - [x] Pass the temporary source folder (containing installer and scripts).
    - [x] Pass the user-specified output folder.
    - [x] Pass the generated `install.ps1` as the setup file.

**VI. Status, Logging, and Error Handling (Milestone 6 & Key Feature 6)**
- [x] Implement a logging mechanism (using the `logging` module) to track application events, external command outputs, and errors. (Partially for external commands)
- [x] Display progress and status updates in the GUI's status area for:
    - [x] Searching Winget.
    - [ ] Downloading installer.
    - [ ] Generating scripts.
    - [ ] Packaging with `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`.
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling for:
    - [x] `winget` command failures (search, download). (Search part done)
    - [ ] `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` execution errors.
    - [ ] File/directory operations (creating temp dirs, saving scripts).
- [x] Report success or failure messages clearly to the user. (For search part)

**VII. File Output Configuration (Milestone 7 & Part of Key Feature 5)**
- [x] Ensure the GUI allows the user to easily select/browse for the destination folder for the final `.intunewin` file. (Partially covered in Milestone 1 UI elements, browse is working)

**VIII. Temporary File Cleanup (Milestone 8)**
- [x] Implement logic to automatically delete the temporary download and script directories after successful packaging.
- [x] Consider an option to keep temporary files for debugging if packaging fails.

**IX. Packaging & Distribution**
- [x] Create a `README.md` for the project with setup and usage instructions.
- [ ] Test the application thoroughly on a target OS.
- [ ] Consider packaging the Python application into an executable (e.g., using PyInstaller or Nuitka) for easier distribution.
